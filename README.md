# Master-Thesis
Collection of materials related to my master's thesis on the topic of information geometry.


Summary
-------
In essence, my thesis discusses ways to generalise simultaneous confidence regions to so-called parameter manifolds in the context of information geometry. In addition, given a dataset and candidate model for its description, an efficient method for determining exact confidence regions irrespective of the chosen parametrisation of a model is developed.

A handout of the slides of a talk aimed at introducing and defending the results of said thesis is also provided.


Corrections
-----------
In addition to the original version that was handed in officially, I will retain the right to also publish updated revisions of my thesis, where typos and formatting errors are incrementally corrected as I find them. In general, I recommend using the newest version.

Changes so far:
* Deleted erroneous duplication of sections 4.6 and 4.7
* Removed section numbering in Appendix


## Numerical Implementation
An implementation of the methods which were developed and discussed in my thesis have been published as the [InformationGeometry.jl](https://github.com/RafaelArutjunjan/InformationGeometry.jl) package for the [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia) programming language. A detailed guide explaining its use will follow soon.
