# Master-Thesis
*Collection of materials related to my master's thesis on the topic of information geometry.*


Summary
-------
In essence, my thesis investigates ways to generalise simultaneous confidence regions to so-called parameter manifolds in the context of information geometry. In particular, an efficient method for determining exact confidence regions irrespective of the chosen parametrisation of the underlying model is developed.

A handout of the slides of a talk aimed at introducing and defending the results of said thesis is also provided.


Corrections
-----------
In addition to the original version that was handed in officially, I will retain the right to also publish updated revisions of my thesis, where typos and formatting errors are incrementally corrected as I find them. In general, I recommend using the newest version.

A reasonably comprehensive list of all corrections can be found in the [Corrections.md](https://github.com/RafaelArutjunjan/Master-Thesis/blob/master/Corrections.md) file.


## Numerical Implementation
An implementation of the methods which were developed and discussed in my thesis have been published as the [**InformationGeometry.jl**](https://github.com/RafaelArutjunjan/InformationGeometry.jl) package for the [Julia programming language](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia). A detailed guide explaining its use can be found in the associated [**documentation**](https://RafaelArutjunjan.github.io/InformationGeometry.jl/dev).
